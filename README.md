## Installation

To install grace as a #lang language:

    $ cd hopper
    $ raco link grace

If you are using racket on a Mac, you may need to add raco to your path.
In ~/.bash_profile add a line:

    export PATH=/Applications/Racket\ v5.3.4/bin:$PATH
(replacing 'v5.3.4' with whatever version of Racket you have)

Then do:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile
